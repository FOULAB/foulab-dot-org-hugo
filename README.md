## Hugo version

Since January 2024, the site is confirmed to work with Hugo v0.111 (Debian 12).

As of September 2023, the site was confirmed to work with Hugo v0.80 (thanks kryma for the fix).

Prior to commit a195c2c, the site required a specific old version of Hugo. Check the history of README for details.
