Exciting news this month! Members and friends of Foulab are planning some November events - and the more days pass, the closer we get.

__[Saturday November 18th @ 19:00 - 21:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

A Trivia night? True Foulabers remember - our very own **kida** used to host a recurring get-together of trivia-inclined minds to keep us together during COVID.

It returns the third Saturday of November, in person at Foulab. Come join us for a treat of an evening!

__[Sunday November 19th @ 10:30 - 17:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

Another partnership with a friendly organization, an open Sunday full of [Debian & Stuff](https://agendadulibre.qc.ca/events/2411) is happening on the 19th. An all-day gathering of Linux enthusiasts and whatever friends would like to come by? Definitely worth it to check it out, if you have a Sunday free.

__[Saturday November 25th @ 15:00 - 17:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

We are going have an organizational meeting. It's a great way to get yourself involved in the local community - and get a peek at the near future of Foulab while you're at it! Swing by, if you're interested.

[Killed by Dice](https://killedbydice.com), a tabletop roleplaying community hosted by Foulab's **der_moderne_man**, humbly invites you to join a public session of Mothership - a nail-biting sci-fi RPG centered around a horror from outer space. ...Gulp. The situation needs urgent player help - please [RSVP here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/killed-by-diodes-mothership-rpg-tickets-754033553657), slots are limited!
