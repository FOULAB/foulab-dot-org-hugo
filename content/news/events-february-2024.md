Another month of Foulab is upon us! Come take a look at what is brewing around the space. Join it perhaps?

### Museum Development Session - Tuesday February 6th @ 19:00 - 23:00

A big proposal has been brewing in our community for a while now.

The plan? Double the museum's size, and let the public have a sitting spot where they can enjoy retro computers at their leisure.

This February, join us for a joint workshop and public feedback session where you can give some input to the new ambitious project's future. Hosted by the talented **computerbomb**, it's sure to be a blast.

<br/>

### Creative Recycling: Making Art with Scrap Material - Tuesday February 20th & Thursday February 22nd @ 19:00 - 22:00

**stuntman**, a local cyberpunk artist, is looking to share his expertise in unconventional sculpture and recycling as an artform. Join us for a two-part workshop during our open nights, and learn a thing or two about sculpting from a professional.

After all, why buy materials when you get them for free with almost every purchase?

### KDE 6th Megarelease Launch Party - Friday March 8th @ 18:00-22:00

Have you heard? [A new major release of KDE Plasma is coming out!](https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/rc2/) Swing by for an extra open night in its honour - we will discuss new features, demo some KDE apps, and try to get as many people as we can onto the Path of the Gear.

Pizza? We got that.

Customizability? We got that.

Join our ~~cool technomancer cult~~ software community.

<br/>

### FOULAB Monthly Meeting - Saturday March 16th @ 15:00 - 17:00

Another monthly organizational meeting comes. Points of discussion - moving forward, financial transparency, museum. Possibly even reviving our community file storage?

These meetings are open to everyone - drop by even if you're not a hardcore Foulaber! We like the company.
