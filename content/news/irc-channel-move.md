Foulab is now officially registered as a project on the Libera.Chat IRC network. This means the channel has moved from `##foulab` to `#foulab` (single hash mark). A redirect has been setup, so your client might already be on the new channel.

This also comes with improvements to foubot like the ability to change the topic with the status of the lab.
