The last month of the year is here! Work winds down, people start working on projects, and with it, a whole stack of interesting things to do appears around the lab. Here are just some of them:

__[Tuesday December 12th @ 18:30 - 23:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

You may have heard of our last unofficial Project Night - an informal gathering where people demo cool stuff they have worked on lately. Good news - our member **noi** is hosting another one just next week! Drop by to see our community's work from professional to casual, or even demo something of your own! See you there.

__[Sunday December 17th @ 15:00 - 19:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

The last event by [Killed by Dice](https://killedbydice.com) has unfortunately been canceled due to a COVID scare. Foulaber **der_moderne_man**'s tabletop RPG community returns to invite guests to an afternoon of Mothership once again. Join us in a thriller RPG set in the far off future. Fight off cosmic horrors on a Sunday? Sounds good to us. [RSVP here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/killed-by-diodes-mothership-rpg-tickets-754033553657) if you want to join us - be wary, slots are limited!


__[Thursday December 21st @ 18:30 - 23:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

A Christmas party? A New Year's party? A weighted average of all the winter-related parties in one convenient Foulab package? Yo!

If there are any events around Foulab to visit this month, this is definitely the one you should show up to. Enjoy a festive mood with fellow hackers and grab a slice of pizza as we send this old year off together ðŸŽ‰


__[Saturday December 30th @ 15:00 - 17:00]({{< ref "calendar.md" >}})__  

Another organizational meeting. We'll tally up 2023, and discuss how we plan to go forward with the things that transpired. Spoiler alert - it's looking pretty good. Join us to see the internal workings of this space, and maybe even make your voice heard on an issue you care about!
