If you've been curious about Mastodon, or maybe set up an account but felt a bit lost, then this is the workshop for you! Our resident Fediverse expert **n00q** will cover the basics, the background, some (light) theory, and demonstrations of how to get started and navigate Mastodon. Bring your questions!
